repository for DSA project 3 group 53

no GUI we all CLI in this project

current priorities:
- reliable graph API (adjacency list with std::unordered_map)
- methods for calculating distance (djikstras, bellman-ford, floyd-warshall)
- randomly generating graphs with arbitrary weights and arbitrary amounts of nodes
- CLI parser
