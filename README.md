no GUI we all CLI in this project

current priorities:
- reliable graph API (adjacency list with std::unordered_map)
- methods for calculating distance (djikstras, A*, bellman-ford, brute force [?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem))
- randomly generating graphs with arbitrary weights and arbitrary amounts of nodes
- CLI parser
