GUI interface for creating graphs and simulating different kinds of graph algorithms (maybe visualizing) 

current priorities:
- reliable graph API (adjacency list with std::unordered_map) 
- methods for calculating distance (djikstras, A*, bellman-ford, brute force [?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem))
- choosing GUI library
- randomly generating graphs with arbitrary weights and arbitrary amounts of nodes
- implementing GUI
